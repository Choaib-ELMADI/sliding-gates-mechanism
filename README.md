# Sliding Gates Mechanism - RoboBasket Challenge 2024

This repository contains all the resources for implementing the sliding gates mechanism used in the `RoboBasket Challenge 2024` by `SEECS Club` ENSA Marrakech. The gates are designed as an obstacle that robots must detect and navigate through during the competition.

## Contents

- **3D Models**: STL files for the sliding doors mechanism, designed for 3D printing.
- **Programs**: Control logic for the gates' open/close timing and operation.
- **Documentation**: Circuit diagrams and technical specifications for the mechanism.

## Mechanism Overview

- **Operation**: The gates operate on a timed cycle, opening for 10 seconds and closing for 3 seconds.
- **Objective**: Robots must detect the gates' status and pass through autonomously.
- **Features**:
  - Sliding in-and-out door mechanism.
  - Precise timing for seamless integration into the competition.

## Usage

1. **3D Printing**:

   - Use the STL files provided in the `3D Models` folder to fabricate the physical components of the gates.

2. **Assembly and Code Deployment**:

   - Follow the instructions in the documentation for assembling the gates and deploying the control logic.

This repository is under active development and will include all finalized components upon completion.
